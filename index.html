                    Developed an advanced text processing tool that utilizes various data structures and algorithms to tokenize input text into words for spell checking. This tool employs the Levenshtein distance algorithm to accurately suggest alternatives for misspelled words. Featuring a command-line interface, it allows users to efficiently input text, receive suggestions, and correct errors in large text documents.
